San Luis Creek had backed up which resulted in significant flooding downtown, including at the corner of Osos and Marsh Streets where KSLY had their studios below grade, in the basement of the San Luis Savings and Loan. The flood was a disaster for them. For the second time since 1969, KSLY had to evacuate its studios and take all of the studio equipment they could salvage to the safety of their transmitter site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another transmitter site was about to play a role in the saga of the flood of 1973. KCPR maintained its transmitter facilities in KVEC's transmitter site on Radio Hill, which is on the Cal Poly campus. As the flooding got worse on campus, power going to affected buildings, including the Graphic Arts Building, was being turned off. On the morning of Jan 18th, KCPR's studios became blacked out. But not KVEC. They were the primary Emergency Broadcast System station for San Luis Obispo and the federal government had provided funds for them to install emergency power generators at their studios and at their transmitter site. So whether the power on the Cal Poly campus was shut off or not, KVEC was still able to generate their own power and stay on the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "KCPR took advantage of KVEC's situation to take our portable audio console up to the transmitter site we shared with them and resumed live programming from there. Steve Ruegnitz and Eric Dausman loaded the portable audio console in Eric's '57 Chevy wagon and hauled it up to Radio Hill where they were joined by Dean Opperman, Al Lindley, Steve Witten and Ron Margaretten. I recall dropping by in my '65 VW but didn't stay long so I hope my friends can collaborate on happened up there.\n",
