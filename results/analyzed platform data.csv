0,,"Beatles, Beach Boys and Blood, Sweat & Tears","In the Fall of 1971, our new DJ Trainees were very interested to know just what music they could play on KCPR. Steve Stagnero, our Program Director, visited the new DJ Training class and he was asked for his recommendations. He simply answered, ""Beatles, Beach Boys and Blood, Sweat & Tears."" So now we knew.

The next thing DJ trainees had to learn was the KCPR music format. It was a fairly complicated policy that divided the broadcast day into six parts and established a different balance of musical content for each part. Even today, KCPR tries to have a consistent sound from one day to the next with regular format programs entitled The Breakfast Club, Afternoon Delight, The Comedown and The Lounge. I don't know how KCPR manages their musical format today but, back in 1971, we had Format Sheets.

From hour to hour, the Format Sheets told us how many ""Popular"", ""Rock"" (not the same thing in a world with both Andy Williams and The Who), ""Oldies"" and ""Heavy"" songs to play. We drew Format Sheets for our shift and filled them out as we played the required combinations of mandatory and optional songs every hour. I do not know if anyone ever looked at them but I don't recall them sticking around very long.

I only had a few air shifts after completing DJ Training in the Fall of 1971 so I only filled out a few of the Format Sheets and don't recall seeing them when we returned for the Winter Quarter in 1972. Fortunately, a few of us that were doing air shifts in the Fall of 1971 are here and hopefully they will tell us more about how KCPR managed music on the air.","Ed O'Brien: I came to Cal Poly as a freshman in fall '70. I'm not sure how the format changed from 1970 to 1971, but I assume it was very much the same. For me, during the afternoon and early evening hours KCPR appeared to be a fierce competitor to KSLY, a top 40, ""boss jock"" type AM station downtown. My first experience at KCPR was watching Steve Lamont (aka Alan Stone) screaming at the top of his voice into the mic, and carefully watching a CraLab photo timer count down the seconds until he ""hit the intro"" perfectly to the bubblegum song ""Judy to you Love Me"" by Bobby Sherman. Once done he would pull up the next 45 rpm record from a box with similar type records, marked with a colored dot with the intro countdown handwritten on the dot, then manually cue it on the QRK quick-start turntable (BTW, cueing now a lost art, it sounded like a modern day rap artist) while listening to it on the cue channel of the control board. On the wall there was a diagram of a typical hour showing the types (by colored dot) of records allowed to be played. Woe to those who ""BROKE THE FORMAT""!!

Only until late at night were DJs allowed to wander off the ""program plantation"". It was then a DJ could finally play album based, ""long versions"" of a song, or heaven forbid, let an album track from one song to the next. As an engineering student from the Bay Area, I preferred the late night approach (KSAN or KSJO style) but learning the quick paced DJ jock style was a big help when I had to occasionally fill in (on-air) at a commercial station. Late evenings where the archies, working on their projects, would call in for requests. They were considered an important audience for many a late nite DJ. Unfortunately, it was also late nights where beginner DJs would hone their craft at trying to announce, keep logs, answer the phone and operate all the manual equipment in the control room. LOTs of screw-ups occurred, and for the more senior staff this was subject of many laughs at weekend parties, of with Zuke in the hallways of the Graphic Arts Bldg.","Ed O'Brien: I came to Cal Poly as a freshman in fall '70.

1,,Teething KCPR - Our General Policies - Fall 1971,"After reading Jim Stueck's senior project, I got the impression that these General Polices were rooted in what Alan Holmes and Jim Stueck had started in 1968-69 but the policies had to evolve to address the growing size of KCPR's staff, its longer operating hours and its expanding studio and transmitter facilities. Writing these policies down and teaching them to the DJ trainees would help everyone work together and keep the student run radio station out of trouble. However, the efficient use of ditto masters in the preparation of this document definitely reminded me of Woody Goulart.

2,,When the Rains Came - January 1973,"This is a test of the Cueback Collaboration System. Anyone listed as a collaborator to this story can add their memories directly to it rather than just make comments. And that is going to be necessary because, as big an event as this was, I don't remember much about it other than who else was there and what was reported in the Mustang Daily.

It was January 18, 1973 and the rain has been falling heavily over San Luis Obispo. San Luis Creek had backed up which resulted in significant flooding downtown, including at the corner of Osos and Marsh Streets where KSLY had their studios below grade, in the basement of the San Luis Savings and Loan. The flood was a disaster for them. For the second time since 1969, KSLY had to evacuate its studios and take all of the studio equipment they could salvage to the safety of their transmitter site.

Another transmitter site was about to play a role in the saga of the flood of 1973. KCPR maintained its transmitter facilities in KVEC's transmitter site on Radio Hill, which is on the Cal Poly campus. As the flooding got worse on campus, power going to affected buildings, including the Graphic Arts Building, was being turned off. On the morning of Jan 18th, KCPR's studios became blacked out. But not KVEC. They were the primary Emergency Broadcast System station for San Luis Obispo and the federal government had provided funds for them to install emergency power generators at their studios and at their transmitter site. So whether the power on the Cal Poly campus was shut off or not, KVEC was still able to generate their own power and stay on the air.

KCPR took advantage of KVEC's situation to take our portable audio console up to the transmitter site we shared with them and resumed live programming from there. Steve Ruegnitz and Eric Dausman loaded the portable audio console in Eric's '57 Chevy wagon and hauled it up to Radio Hill where they were joined by Dean Opperman, Al Lindley, Steve Witten and Ron Margaretten. I recall dropping by in my '65 VW but didn't stay long so I hope my friends can collaborate on happened up there.

According to the story in the Mustang Daily, KCPR conducted broadcasting on Radio Hill from 10:15AM to 5PM on Jan 18th.

3,,The Unsung Reunion - 1999,"Actually it was a pretty big reunion. Alumni did air shifts over the weekend and many of those were preserved on tape recordings that are currently held in the Kennedy Library.

Ed O'Brien, Lou Rinaldi and me teamed up for a one hour broadcast on Saturday morning. Lou was KCPR's ""Broadcaster of the Year"" back in 1970 but he graduated that year and I missed meeting him. He was good friends with Ed though. When we got to the studio, I took the controls and Lou and Ed took the microphones. I brought my copy of Rhino Records ""Have a Nice Decade, The '70s Pop Culture Box"" and we played selections from that for the whole hour, winding up with ""The Morning After"" by Maureen McGovern. I was saving that one!

Everyone ended up at Toyon group area in Cuesta Park for presentations by Scott Cody and a nice BBQ, a tradition the alumni have kept up for subsequent KCPR reunions.

Then they started using mobile radio equipment to go out in the field and send back live reports from around campus. KCPR was busy covering Poly Royal in 1973.

The Establishment of Campus Radio At California State Polytechnic College 
by James D. Stueck

California State Polytechnic College
San Luis Obispo, California
1969

Dedication

The campus radio station of California State Polytechnic College, San Luis Obispo - KCPR and this paper are dedicated in the memory of a man without whose help would have made both impossible.  That man was Glen H. Smith, Instructor of the Department of English and Speech.

Introduction

In keeping with the philosophy of California State Polytechnic College’s “learn by doing”, my senior project is the formation of Campus Radio, KCPR.  The number of hours spent on this project can only be estimated but knowing that an average of 60 hours a week were spent at the station or with work concerning the station and the fact that I put in a full 52 weeks on this project, then the total number of hours spent comes to approximately 4,000 hours for the whole year.  I spent about 50 per cent of my time on the administrative problems that occurred during the formation of the station.  The other 50 per cent of the time was spent divided between programming the station with the different programs the the students wanted to hear, and the actual management of the station while working with the students involved with the station in their different capacities.  Here follows then a narrative description of important events involved in the formation of the station.

Report

In January of 1968 the campus radio committee here at Cal Poly started to get down to business at hand of putting a radio station on-the-air.  It had been nineteen years in the making and now, at last, the end was in sight.  There had been many students who had worked on the committee during those nineteen years, and at one time the station was considered to be a carrier current station that would service all the existing dormitories.  Whatever happened to that particular proposal is lost in the unrecorded meetings that occurred after the decision to go ahead was given by the Student Affairs Council.  Some of the original students that worked with the committee were Robert Nichol, who was designated station manager once the station was on the air.  Bob graduated and served only to share in the fun of ordering all the technical equipment.  Mr. Glen Smith, faculty station manager, asked that Alan Holmes work with Bob and eventually take over the job of station manager.  Gary Fernstrom was program director; Jim Stueck was asked to work with Gary programming the upcoming broadcast hours.  Steve Mieth was the original chief engineer, and Jim Long worked with him in getting the right equipment installed.  Steve Mieth was the student who signed his life away on the government papers that are sent to the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C.  There were other students involved as the program went along, but these are the people who stayed with the idea and worked the longest and hardest.

The problem encountered with the Federal Government and the F.C.C. were many and varied.  Owing to the fact that the June graduation for the Class of 1968 was coming and all the equipment needed to go on the air was in existence, and the fact that the application had been in Washington since the month of March, and everyone expected to be on the air by the month of June, after all what could were be to hold up the works?  Permission to broadcast the graduation ceremonies was requested.  On June 4th, at the request of Alan Holmes and Jim Stueck, Dr. Kennedy the President of the college, sent a telegram to the F.C.C. and asked permission to broadcast the graduation ceremonies (See Appendix A). The resulting telegram from the Federal Government was an eye opening experience in to the workings of the government agencies.  Not only was the station denied permission to broadcast the graduation ceremonies, they had never heard of Cal Poly’s application (See Appendix B and C).  Dr. Kennedy then asked Don Nelson, the college’s business manager, to find out just what was going on back in Washington.  A number of phone calls were made, and it became evident that the application was placed in someone’s “in file” and that’s just where it remained collecting dust.  The phone calls back to Washington started the wheels of government rolling once again. The overworked staff of the Commission finally found the “lost” application and it was processed immediately.

At this time it must be safe to relate that the summer quarter of “68” was starting and that now, after having the equipment installed for some time now, all that had to be done was wait for the construction permit giving the necessary permission to do what was already done.  In time the permit was sent allowing construction of the station.  Assuming this gave us the right to broadcast it was found out later that call letters had to be assigned first.  So, another phone call was placed and the little item was taken care of in a week’s time.  KCPR which stands for Cal Poly Radio was assigned, and the station went on the air.  The Federal Communications Commission has been called from time to time to find explanations for different ruling concerning an educational non-commercial station.  It was discovered that it was faster to place a phone call to Washington than to write a letter for it is the policy of the commission to reply the same way as you inquired.  The time saved in talking to the the people directly in Washington was seen in the time it took to get the construction permit. It came two days after the call was placed.  When all was said and done, the Federal Government was a complicated system to work out.  Such complications included vast amounts of paper work and many of the regulations had to be met (See Appendix I). But the problems that were encountered wth the Federal Government were small compared to the difficulties that occurred with the administration here at Cal Poly.

 The college administrators are people who are very much used to having a negative decision come down from the top.  It was this fact alone which that stopped a lot of the the action as far as the college was concerned.  Alan and Jim experienced a great deal of “administrative red tape.”  For it seemed no one person wanted to give the OK on station decisions.  There are two factors that started the station on the road to success.  One of the first problems that had to be met was where to put the station’s studios.  There are many suggestions for the studio location but most were rejected for one reason or another.  One of the better places that had been thought of was the audio control room in the back of the Little Theater. It was considered for the reason that at that time the station was under the control of the new Speech Department.  There was also under consideration a number of rooms that were at the time receiving little use.  Then there was an informal conference held between Murray Smith, a Speech and Drama instructor, Alan Holmes, Jim Stueck and Jim Long.  The sole purpose of the meeting was to view the studio to see if it would or could be made into a station.  It was at this time that Murray Smith suggested the room above the chorus room in the music part of the building.  He also said there were some empty racks which were left when the equipment was stolen a few years back.  At this time Jim Stueck and Jim Long went over to the rooms and asked the custodian to let them into the room.  Once up there the two Jims met Mr. Day who is the technician for the Music Department.  When he asked what the business was of the two students looking at the rooms they informed him that they were merely looking at the empty studio and the empty racks in the room.  It was also mentioned that the room could be used as a future site of the radio studio.  The next day Alan Holmes and Jim Stueck were informed that the head of the Music Department, Mr. Davidson, had not only
found out about the visitation of the two students to “his” rooms but had also chastised Murray Smith and called the Dean of Applied Arts and demanded to know just what was going on.  (It was also learned later the Mr. Davidson had told Dr. Kennedy; they neighbors.)   Alan and Jim were also told that Jim Stueck had been loud and disrespectful to one of the music instructors.  A check with Jim Long who was with Jim Stueck the whole time showed that at no time did he feel that Jim Struck had been disrespectful to a teacher.  This whole incident then pretty much took care of any hopes of the station locating in the Little Theater.  The one place that seemed best suited was Graphic Arts room 201 which was set aside to be a radio production room.  The one main reason that the station was not allowed to use the room immediately was the fact that the room was under the control of the Journalism Department, and the head of Journalism, Mr. Healey, was not going to give up “his” room for some radio station that wasn’t even in his department.  A plan of reverse psychology was introduced by Glen Smith..  He presented to the President the idea of going into a trailer somewhere adjacent to the Little Theater. Needless to say, the President went through the roof of “407” and that was that.  Graphics Arts 201 was designated as the studio location.

At this point in time the death of Glen Smith occurred, and work slowed down for a few weeks.  Then Alan and Jim along with the rest of the students took the bull by the horns and started to work at getting the station built.  One of the decisions that did help the station on the road to success was the one the President made putting the studios in Graphic Arts room 201. Another incident that occurred that jarred some of the administrators was one involving Pacific Telephone.  It seems that someone from the phone company said there were no open lines between the administration building and the Graphics Arts building.  Thus, there had to be a new line installed between the two buildings.  This is what Alan and Jim were told by one of the administrators involved in helping to set the plans in motion.  At the time it seemed to be a problem that would hold up the completion of the station for some time.  Alan and Jim Stueck paid a visit to the phone company merely to find out if this were true.  During the visit it was mentioned that there was some talk of putting the transmitter and the antenna on top of the Graphic Arts building.  That action would have eliminated the phone company from the picture and they didn’t want that to happen. It was learned at this meeting that to the knowledge of the phone company at no time did they say that there were no open lines between the Graphic Arts building and the Administration building.  It was thought that someone in the administration did not want to sign a ten year lease proposed by the phone company which had to be signed between the college and the phone company before the line would be installed.  The very next day after Alan and Jim went to the phone company, “mother bell” was at the school fixing the lines.  When asked why they were there the phone company said that two students from the radio station gave them permission to do so.  Needless to say, that surprised some administrators and the two boys that the phone company was referring to.  For approximately two weeks there was some amount of letter writing and talk going on but finally the lease was signed and there was permission coming down from the top to go on the air for a testing period (See Appendix H).  

It was during the months of June, July, and August that Alan and Jim spent much of their time in the administration building going from administrator to administrator trying to find one of them to take the initiative to make the decisions that were needed to help the station get on the air.  It is both Alan’s and Jim’s feeling that they received one of the biggest runarounds ever given out by the administrators.   This is felt because it is a fact that no one would make any type of decision without getting an OK from another administrator. This way no one person could receive all the blame if something went wrong.  This proved to be more frustrating and time consuming to Alan and Jim.  The experience that both Jim and Alan put down as far as the radio station was concerned was the fact that they both spent six months in the administration building getting the station on the air.
     
Then there is the existing problem that has come up from time to time between the campus radio station and the different departments on campus.  Each department has over the years established itself as a complex dynasty within the college. At the latter part of the summer of 1968 after the President of the college put the station in Graphics Arts 201, the lock on the door of that room was changed one afternoon with no notice at all.  Since the equipment for the station was already in the room and Alan and Jim were working on the equipment trying to have it ready to go on the air as soon as possible they were both a little upset with the fact that neither one of them could get back into the room.  A call was placed to the Dean of Applied Arts, and he knew nothing of the matter at all.  A quick check with the man that changed the lock soon showed that Mr. Healey had arranged the lock changed so that no one could get into the room.  He succeeded in that not even the students who had business in the room could get back in.  So, another slow up in the process came about.  Another call was placed to the Dean of Applied Arts and finally the keys to the room were issued to Alan and Jim.

The other department that campus radio ran head long into was the Audio Visual Department.  This department still to this day had not fully cooperated with the station.  The equipment that the department has would be a help in making the station sound as professional as possible.  The existing equipment in Graphic Arts 201 is under the Audio Visual Department, that is they are responsible for the maintenance of all the equipment that was in the room before campus radio arrived on the scene.  Numerous attempts were made to get the Audio Visual Department to make minor repairs on the equipment.  It took an order from the President of the college to get one of the Ampex Tape Decks fixed.  There were notes left from the Audio Visual people “to whom it may concern” that were not necessary and uncalled for but pointed out the lack of cooperation between the two entities.  Jim Stueck, who had some experience in working with the type of equipment that the department handles and also headed up an Audio Visual Department at Lompoc High School was the one student that always seemed to get the brunt of the attacks from Audio Visual.  It was felt this was caused by early mistakes made by both Jim and members of the Audio Visual Department.  The differences have never been settled and there’s doubt if they ever will be.  The radio station needed equipment such as microphones, extension cords, amplifiers and other similar equipment order to do a complete audio coverage of the aspects involved in programming. The members of campus radio are well qualified to operate and take care of the equipment loaned to the station.  But, it was AV’s feeling that the students were not responsible enough to handle it.  Thus, the problem arose and it still exists today.  In the last quarter of the school year, the AV department did give campus radio some “extra” equipment that was not in use at the time and the station did put it to good use.  Cooperation with the other departments on campus was slow in coming but still there is not the full cooperation needed to make the station work the way it should be able to work on a college campus.  

July 29, 1968 was the first day campus radio went on the air.  There were many technical problems that had to be corrected.  First and foremost, our assigned carrier was transmitting KVEC’s signal along with KCPR’s.  The transmitter is in the same building as KVEC’s up on radio hill on the campus adjacent to Highway 1.  The phone company did not put in shielded wire.  Thus, the signal from KVEC was getting into the transmitter and interfering with the program.  Jim Long and company did some fine work and soon our signal was going out over the airwaves, that is as soon as Jim hooked up the antenna wire between the transmitter and the antenna, a slight oversight on his part.  

Alan Holmes and Jim Stueck worked in between trips to the administration building on just what would be put on the air once the station was operating. They worked out many different plans and came up with the idea of inserting educational programs within live disc jockey programs.  Originally all programs were to be taped, but this soon proved to be impossible, the main factor being the time element.  A show that would run two hours would take almost four to five hours to make up, and with a limited staff that was working at the time they couldn’t see their way clear to do all programs by tape.  The programs that were done by tape were the different educational programs.  Most of these were homemade creations since the station did not and still does not have any money to spend on pre-taped shows from different educational outlets. Of course, it was also realized that some educational programming should be done live to make it more interesting.  Notes began to fly as the station getting closer to completion (See appendix D and E). Live programs always seemed to interest the listener more than some of the taped programs that were offered. We did have a great deal of success with one taped program at the beginning, and that was “The History of Railroading In San Luis Obispo.” This tape combined sound effects and a good deal of interesting information that was of interest to everyone.  It was programs of the same standard that we tried to maintain throughout the year.  

From the start we didn’t have too much of a problem with people wanting to work on the station; there was plenty for all to do.  As a matter of fact Alan took the first three hours and Jim took the next three hours.  That night they traded shifts.  Soon there was a sizable staff working for the station.  Rod Allen was put in charge of making up “phony spot commercials.” Robert Seibly was in charge of getting some information on the President of the college which his wife gave freely.  Even President Kennedy was to do his part by giving an opening address to go over the air on our first night (See Appendix F). Both the phony commercials and the first educational program “The Life of Robert” caused a letter to come down from the President’s office.  And that was one letter the station needed.  For Dr. Kennedy’s support was one thing needed to stay on the air (See Appendix G). 

There were other problems within the station besides a lack of staff and that was the lack of strong leadership from the new faculty station manager hired by the college.  It must be said in all fairness to Dr. Martin (Faculty Station Manager) that he was working with two students that had seen the station through three months of thick and thin times and who were now completely dedicated to the cause of campus radio.  Dr. Martin knew that he would have to wait at first to see where he stood with all of the factions involved with the radio station.  The only trouble is he waited all year!  There was no support whatever from his classes that he was teaching in radio, and the Speech Department did not give credit for work done on the station until the Winter quarter and even then it came only after pressure was applied to them.  The students that did work on the station must have had a great deal of dedication to the station or to the idea of radio for none of the students were given any incentive to continue working, and there was a loss of many fine students from the staff because of the lack of credit.  It was later learned that Dr. Martin’s real interests were in the field of television and this would account for the lack of cooperation as far as the direction of the radio classes in the Speech Department towards helping campus radio.  Dr. Martin has now taken a job at San Diego State College where he will be the head of the Closed Circuit Television Department that handles all educational broadcasts within the college itself.  The new Faculty Station Manager is Ed Zuchelli, former owner of radio station KCOY and KCOY-TV in Santa Maria.  It was felt that in hiring Mr. Zuchelli a practical knowledge of radio would be made available to the students working on KCPR.  

There is another problem that has occurred on the staff on the station, and that is why does everyone dislike the program director?  This is one question that may take many years to answer.  It can be seen for sure that no one would like him.  The job has many responsibilities and will make no friends at all.  If the program director is not at the station when the students want to know something at that particular moment they tend to think the program director is not interested in what they are doing.  Also, there is at the present time a dangerous lack of communication between the staff members and the program director.  The staff very often refuses to listen to the orders from the programmer. In some instances certain people were able to turn the whole staff against the program director and make it look as if he wasn’t doing his job.  The only way that this problem was overcome was by an honest effort on the part of the program director to work with the people and show them that there was a great deal of concern for the station and the way it sounded.  It is hoped that in the future the mistakes made during the first year will serve as examples.  But, there is some doubt that students will ever work together in unity on this project.

Even with the internal problems found within the staff of KCPR there were produced some programs that do credit for the people who worked on the station.  The Sunday night programming was the best example of what the station could air when a concerted effort was placed in the planning of the programs.  The opening two hours of Sunday night was taken up with Sunday Serenade.  The first one was written and produced by Mr. Johnson, band director (See Appendix O). The format that he established was one that was followed throughout the year.  It included the first section of the program in light music then followed by a heavier classical piece and the last part of the program being lighter once again.  The next two hours involved a program called Theater Unlimited.  Ed Pinson was the moderator for this program that included the best in musical show tunes and music from various plays.  The rest of the programming followed a college rock format which the average college students wants to hear.  President Kennedy agreed that if you could give the listener the type of music they wanted to hear, you could feed the students educational programs and make it easier for the students to want to listen.

As time went on the station performed more services for the college.  Programs provided music for the President’s reception at the beginning of the year (See Appendix Q).  Campus radio also provided complete coverage of Poly Royal 1969 (See Appendix R).  The station acquired a Motorola Portable transmitter through the recognition of the Student Affairs Council.  Its primary function was to find use broadcasting the meetings of the student body’s government session.  The transmitter was also used as an auxiliary transmitter for broadcasting the remaining home baseball games at the Cal Poly diamond (See Appendix S and T).

Conclusion

If it hadn’t been for President Kennedy and his willingness to listen to the problems encountered early in the life of the station, it’s certain that the station would still be on paper.  The men that are supposed to help the students with a learning process did everything they could to slow up the process.  The main reason being that they were all afraid to take any responsibility without first finding out if they would be hurt in any way.  It hadn’t been until just recently that these administrators have given any encouragement to the people working on the station.  The other problem was trying to get any cooperation from different departments on campus.  There was a complete lack of cooperation to give anything in the way of equipment so that the station would be able to do and go different places that were needed to make it an effective radio station.  The whole problem was based on the fact that the station was too new of a concept and that there are two students running the operation. One thing that may be seen during the station’s second year of operation is there will be eight students running the station!  If there had been better cooperation in the beginning it is felt that many problems could have been eliminated.  The station, as it stands today, is a symbol of the work that can be put into an operation to help the students in the Cal Poly tradition of “Learn By Doing.”",nan,nan,,"{'audio control room': 0.5, 'Ed Pinson': 0.5, '1969': 0.44999999552965164, 'government agencies': 0.4000000059604645, 'radio station': 0.20000000298023224, 'San Diego State College': 0.20000000298023224, 'people': 0.20000000298023224, 'Closed Circuit Television Department': 0.20000000298023224, 'studios': 0.15000000223517418, 'California State Polytechnic College': 0.10000000149011612, 'James D.

7,,1. The 10-Watt Power Increase,"by Len Filomeo
 
Do you know how powerful that light bulb is in your refrigerator?  Well that's about how powerful KCPR's signal was about to become in 1970!  Although KCPR was licensed for 1.8 watts of power, class D stations like KCPR were already protected from interference as if they were full 10-watt stations. Therefore, Cal Poly only had to apply to the FCC for a construction permit to increase KCPR’s transmitter power output from 1.8 watts to 10 watts. The application was filed on October 9, 1969.  The FCC in turn issued a construction permit to build the 10-watt facilities on October 27, 1969. KCPR would continue to use its existing Jampro JA-1BE antenna. 
 
The new 10-watt transmitter came in the form of a Visual Electronics DFM-10B.  Eric recalls that it was purchased low bid through normal state government procurement channels for about $10,000 while KCPR was still part of the Speech Department.  Jim Long remembers that this was done in a sneaky way so as to not offend the other projects that were competing for the same money. It was claimed that all of the competing projects were written on paper slips and the department chairman's secretary drew one of the projects out of the bowl.  It was KCPR’s new transmitter!  The drawing was supposedly done with just the two of them present. (So no one else was there to say what actually happened.)
 
Visual Electronics introduced their DFM-10A at the 1966 NAB Convention.  The DFM-10B that KCPR used was the same transmitter housed in a stand-alone cabinet. The design of the transmitter was a couple of years old by the time Cal Poly bought one for KCPR but, by that time, Visual Electronics was not doing so well. The New York Times reported that they suffered a $10 million loss in March of 1970 and defaulted on their loan payments in July. Visual subsequently went out of business. This was especially unfortunate because the DFM-10B would remain in service at KCPR for many more years to come.
 
Ed O’Brien commented that the DFM-10B required a lot of work before it was ready to go on the air.  Marty Hijmans even kept its packing crate stored up at the transmitter site, as it had twice before proved useful for returning the 10-watt transmitter to the factory for adjustments.  Even after all that, the transmitter was reputed to suffer from frequent bouts of irregularity.  The common symptom was hearing KCPR appear simultaneously on many places on the FM band. If you lived close enough to the transmitter site, you could tune your FM receiver across the band and hear KCPR on two or three different spots on the dial. Our motto could have been, “Keep it to the left, right and center!”
 
At one point we found a problem in the Acopian power supply that provided DC power for the phase lock loop circuitry that controlled the transmitter’s frequency, but the problems continued. Ed was concerned that AC voltage excursions and spikes were coming through the power mains and they were making it through the DC power supplies in the Visual transmitter. He obtained a regulating AC transformer from the Electrical Engineering Department and used it to isolate the DFM-10B from the AC power mains.  The transformer ran hot but its use of core saturation finally stopped (or at least slowed) issues the transmitter was experiencing with frequency instability.  

KCPR made preparations for the remote control of the 10-watt transmitter.  As with the 2-watt transmitter, FCC regulations for operating the 10-watt transmitter were uncomplicated.  KCPR did not have to monitor the operating parameters of the transmitter's final amplifier and take readings every 30-minutes as was then the norm for more powerful radio stations back then.  Our transmitter logs consisted merely of entries for when we turned the transmitter on and off, and who was the operator on duty from the start of one air shift to the next.  All we really had to do was maintain positive control of the transmitter, so we could turn it off if something went wrong.  The responsibility for building the new remote control system went to Ed O'Brien.  He took a nice picture of it too, shown below.
 
As was done with the 2-watt transmitter, the remote control worked by imposing a DC current in the copper wire phone line that carried the audio from the studio to the transmitter.  So long as the current flowed, a set of relay contacts at the transmitter site would remain closed and the 10 watt transmitter would stay on the air.  But if the current was stopped, the relay contacts would open and electrical power to the transmitter would be shut off.  Turning on the remote control started the current flowing to activate the transmitter, and turning it off shut down the transmitter.  

There was still a key in the switch to turn the remote control on and off.  Ed remembers that we used the key to simply turn off the transmitter at sign-off and left the key in the lock. We then locked up the studio to prevent anyone from making unauthorized use of the transmitter.  Then KCPR went to 24 hour operation so eventually we only had to sign-off for quarter break. (Now, with automation and 24 hour off-site transmitter monitoring, KCPR rarely signs off at all.) 
 
The photo also features the ""KCPR Audio Switcher"".  This was intended to allow us to switch the program line to the transmitter to either the new Master Control room or Production Control.  It was really nice to be able to switch Production on air and originate programming from there when we needed to work on Master Control.  
 
And, oh yes, at the bottom of the picture, the Altec 436C Compression Amplifier. It was intended to help prevent overmodulation while at the same time increasing the apparent loudness of the station by compressing the dynamic range of the audio.   Unfortunately, this compression amp wasn't designed with FM radio stations in mind.  It wasn't designed to accommodate the FM pre-emphasis curve, and it had a distinct tendency to clip audio waveforms when it was pushed far enough into compression to affect the apparent loudness of the station.  However it worked well enough when allowed to simply ride gain on the stations audio level, and remained in service though out the station's mono years.

8,,2. New Master Control Room 1971 – Design,"KCPR only maintained Radio Control in Room 201 for a short time.  Plans were already in motion to increase both the size and the coverage of the nascent 1.8 watt radio station.  The adjacent classroom space in Room 202 was due to be converted into more studios and offices for the station, and a power increase to 10 watts was on the way.

These tasks were performed between 1970 and 1971.  Everything was pretty much in place by the time I arrived in the Fall of 1971. 

Craig Hines tells me that the design of the new Master Control Room was a senior project of Bill Gurzi, who was also a DJ at KSLY. (The project was entitled “Design for a broadcast control room for KCPR” by William R. Gurzi, 1971.)  Bill adopted the design of KCPR's master control room from KSLY's, with the idea of making a few improvements.  Below is what the KSLY studio looked like in 1970 (before the flood of 1973).

9,,3. New Master Control Room 1971 – Construction,"The campus carpentry department actually built the cabinetry that housed KCPR’s new audio board, turntables, records and carts per Bill Gurzi's designs, and they did a pretty nice job of it too.  

With Bill already a senior and otherwise occupied at KSLY, most of the credit for installing the new control room facilities in 1970-71 went to he station's chief engineer, Marty Hijmans.  Fortunately, Ed O'Brien worked along side of Marty during much of this work, so he has been able to provide some further insights into the construction of the new control room.

The new control room was built around the flexible yet inexpensive 8-channel Sparta A-20 audio console.  The Sparta was a mainstay of small market radio stations on the west coast and particularly in San Luis Obispo.  At the time, both KSLY and KVEC had them on the air. 
 
The origins of KCPR's A-20 audio console were complicated.  Craig remembers the A-20 originated with Glenn Daly, who was a graduate of the IT department and the engineer of KVEC's former studios on Walnut Street.  Glenn had formally worked at Sparta in Sacramento, and was able to arrange to have the audio console donated to Cal Poly in parts, rather then as finished goods.   Eric Dausman recalled that KCPR bought some of the larger pieces of the Sparta board, like the front panel, chassis and circuit cards.  It's hard to palm a front panel assembly.  Ed remembers that the rest of the Sparta board's parts, such as knobs, switches and electronic components, were delivered in plastic bags to Marty Hijmans.  He assembled the parts, installed the circuit cards, and performed all of the wiring inside the board.  Marty's wiring dress was very professional, it looked like the board had been wired on the factory floor.  
 
Bill Gurzi’s studio fit together perfectly, and the ergonometrics were just right for doing a radio show with records and tapes.  You can get a pretty good perspective on the new control room from the picture in the picture below, featuring Blair Helsing on the air. 
 
The picture of Blair Helsing also shows that Master Control was using an Electro-Voice 635A microphone.  The EV 635A was another mainstay of SLO radio stations.  You could buy one of these durable omnidirectional dynamic microphones for about 50 bucks at Mid State Electronics. (Where they didn't give a DAMN how it's done in LA!)  KCPR used the EV 635A on air in Master Control, but it was also a popular news gathering microphone around campus and at the commercial stations downtown.  KCPR's cadre of 635A's went on remotes, they went on interviews, and they always worked.  They were reputed to be so durable that you could drive nails with them, and still use them as microphones.  Well, we didn't drive nails with them very often, but I still keep an EV 635A frequented around my loft, just in case.

10,,4. Back Cuing and Slip Cuing,"The dominant feature of KCPR's control room was the turntables mounted under the Sparta audio console. The turntables were Rek-O-Kut model B-12-GH rim drive turntables with Shure model M232 tone arms.  These tone arms were typically adjusted to for a tracking force of 3 grams (although grams are a unit of mass, not force).  But that much tracking force was really needed to keep the stylus in the grove.  The Rek-O-Cuts were considered ""instant start"" turntables, as they could get up to full speed in just about one quarter revolution.  
 
We did somethings back then called ""back cueing"" and ""slip cueing"" to perform segues with records on the air.  The turntable's platters were covered in felt.  That felt allowed the records to be spun by hand over the turntable while it remained stationary.  To back cue, you would switch the audio from the turntable into the cue channel, bring the tone arm over to the record and place the stylus in the record grove near the track you wanted to play, as shown in the picture below. Then you spun the record forward by hand until you heard the first audio from that track through the cue speaker. Then you spun the record backwards about a quarter turn, so the stylus is resting just far enough back from the start of the track to allow you to execute an instant start.  Finally, you put the turntable audio back into program and waited for the record that you were playing to fade before executing a competent segue.  This would also be a good time to double check that the turntables speed was set correctly to 45 or 33-1/3 rpm. 

Some DJ's liked to give the record three of four back cues when they cued it, just to make sure they had the stylus exactly where they wanted it.  But for those connoisseurs who did not wish to rely on the Rek-O-Cut's ability to start quickly, there was another technique we called “slip cueing”.  After you back cued the record, you would hold it in place with one hand and start the turntable spinning underneath it, thus causing the turntable to slip under the record while you waited for the record that was playing to fade. Obviously you could cue much tighter with this technique because you didn't have to leave that quarter turn for the turntable to get up to speed.  Then you would release the record exactly on the beat of the music and execute nothing less than a brilliant, breathtaking segue! 

Needless to say, this kind of handling was tough on records, styluses and phono cartridges alike.  KCPR used the Staton V500E phono cartridges.  They were built for the demands of the broadcast environment and were intended to use a tracking force of 3 grams. We also preferred to use the spherical tipped stylus over the conical tipped ones.  The conical tipped stylus offered better fidelity, but the spherical stylus produced less record wear and extended the life of the station's record library.

11,,5. Putting callers on the air - That don't bother us at all,"Putting callers on the air live was a big deal in the early 70's.  Besides hosting game shows like “Testing 1-2-3”, the station had regular public affairs shows on Sunday nights where people were encouraged to call in.  There was also an active news department that would phone-in stories. 
 
To facilitate putting callers on the air, there was a row of pushbuttons under the Sparta console in master control. Reading from left to right, the buttons labeled 40 and 41 referred to the station's two phone lines, 805-544-4640 and 4641.  
 
Selecting either the 40 or 41 button activated a phone patch that connected the selected phone line to one of the Sparta's auxiliary inputs, and also to its program output.  This allowed a caller to be put on the air and they could also hear the program audio from the console.  That way the callers could carry on a two-way conversation over the air with the DJ.  Special precautions were taken to avoid feedback when the phone line was simultaneously connected to both the input and the output of the audio console. 
 
Preventing feedback required a four-wire terminating set, otherwise known as a hybrid phone patch. One side of the phone patch was connected to the phone line. The other side of the patch connected the phone line to the input of the Sparta console so we could hear the callers over the air. The phone patch also connected the output of the console back to the phone line so the callers could hear the DJ and we could carry on a two-way conversation with them. The phone patch kept the output of the console isolated from its input to avoid feedback.

Conducting live call-ins also placed a burden on the station to prevent callers from using profanity on the air.  The generally accepted way to do that involved a tape-delay.  We would delay the program audio by a few seconds before it went to the transmitter.  This gave us time to intervene and interrupt the audio if someone said something profane and prevent that from getting on the air.  
 
There was specialized equipment designed to provide tape delays available to commercial radio stations but we didn't have any of that. Instead, we would produce our call-in shows in the Production Room and made use of the two open-reel Ampex tape decks in there that were mounted adjacent to each other in the racks.  Facing the tape decks, we would load a large reel of audio tape on the feed spindle of the deck on the left.  Then we would thread the audio tape past that deck's tape heads (bypassing the pinch roller) and across to the deck on the right.  The tape would then be thread past the right-hand deck's tape heads as well, then between its capstan and pinch roller, and finally to the take-up reel on the right side of the deck.  
 
The decks were then started with the deck on the left in record and the take-up deck on the right used for playback.  The deck on the left would record the program audio as it left the audio board.  It would then take the recording a few seconds to pass across the gap to the playback deck, which gave us the tape delay we needed.  The output of the right deck was then sent to the transmitter. If we heard a caller say something profane in the studio, we would be able to mute the audio in time and prevent any profanity from getting on the air.  
 
 
Our call-in shows didn't attract profanity so we rarely had to actually mute the audio during them.  Although we recorded a lot of these shows through the tape delay, very few recordings remain because we didn't have a lot of tape and had to keep reusing it every week.

12,,6. The 2000 Watt Power Increase,"by Len Filomeo
 
As much as the students would have liked to have taken KCPR stereo, even as a 10 watt station, there was no obvious way to do it.  Glenn Daly had moved on, and nobody was offering us stereo studio and transmitter facilities, in kit form or otherwise.  However, in 1972 otherwise apparently unrelated events were coalescing into a real opportunity for the station to achieve another milestone.

Homer Odem, owner of KSLY, the “Famous Fourteen”, had bought KATY-FM from John Grandy. KATY-FM’s assets included an FM license to operate on 96.1 Mhz, a Bauer 1 KW FM transmitter, an ITA 1KW transmitter, some transmission line and not much else. Homer left behind everything but the FM license which he renamed KUNA-FM.  KATY-AM on 1340Khz remained in John Grandy's hands until he sold it to Duane Hill a year later.  

Eric Dausman came to Cal Poly from the same hometown as Harold Hallikainen.  Eric enrolled in the Fall quarter of 1972 and joined KCPR's staff.   Connections were being made and opportunities were being uncovered.

Indeed, it came as a complete surprise to me when Eric brought KATY-FM's old ITA 1 KW FM transmitter back to KCPR's Studio B. This was my first hint that a significant power increase for KCPR was a real possibility.

The ITA transmitter had resided in KATY's studios, which were located above the former VW dealership at 1146 Monterey Street, with their FM antenna mounted on the roof of the building.  The ITA (also known as a “Bernie Box” after its inventor Bernie Wise) was actually a donation from Sparta Electronics.  They had sold KATY-FM a Bauer model 607A 1 KW transmitter and had taken the ITA in as trade.  But it was not worth shipping anywhere, so it just sat there alongside the new Bauer.  Eric recalls that it was fairly easy to convince Sparta to donate it.  Moving it would be harder.  

KATY's location above the VW dealership on Monterey Street made it accessible only by a staircase, a narrow staircase at that.  Eric remembers going over to KATY with a few friends in a borrowed pick up truck.  The first thing they did was to take the power transformer out of the ITA transmitter.  That was put on a furniture dolly and carefully moved down the stairs.  Then they did the same for the transmitter cabinet. Then they both went into the pickup truck.   

The transmitter was brought to the dock behind the Graphics Arts building, and rolled through the print shop downstairs to the elevator. From there it was brought up to the 2nd floor where it was rolled down the hall to the studios.   At the time, the station manager's office hadn't been built.  So the area to the right as you came into the station from the hallway was still wide open.  The engineering shop was still at the far end, so the ITA ended up outside the shop where we could bring it back to life.

The ITA was inadequately neutralized against regenerative feedback to prevent oscillation in its final power amplifier.  It was dangerous to operate under local control, much less under remote control.  It might have been considered more dangerous to operate it under local control, because that would have meant you had to be in the same room with it!  We did a lot of work on it that fall, trying to make an honest transmitter out of it.  
 
Dr. Dickey came over from the Electrical Engineering Department to give us a few tips on stabilizing the transmitter. After looking it over, he recommended we seal all of the doors to the final amplifier cabinet with conductive gaskets. He told us, “You have to treat RF like gas under pressure, no leaks.”

The 1 KW transmitter would also need a proper antenna.  The current JA-1-BE antenna was only rated for up to 50 watts of power.  Fortunately, the Jampro Antenna Company in Sacramento was about to come into receipt of a used 4-bay antenna in trade from KZSU-FM, Stanford.  They were willing to trade that to KCPR in exchange for a collection of 3-1/8 and 1-5/8 inch rigid transmission line that Steve Ruegnitz, Harold Hallikainen and friends had brought down with them from KKDJ (now known as KIIS) on Mt. Wilson a couple of years earlier.  

Rick Smith and Eric took the transmission line up to Jampro to make the exchange.  Unfortunately, KZSU had been unable to make the planned upgrade to its antenna system, and the aforementioned 4-bay antenna was not available.  But just so nobody went home empty handed, Jampro provided us with two more of their famous V style horizontally polarized antenna bays and a couple of feedlines of RG-218 coax with LC connectors to hook them up.  They also provided charts with the antenna's measurements, extra brass tubing, and caps for the ends of the antenna elements.  The caps treaded onto the ends of the elements, allowing the antenna to be tuned over a limited range by just twisting the end caps to adjust the length of the elements.  Mounting these two antenna bays vertically on a tower at a spacing of one wavelength would allow them to achieve a gain of about 2 over a single-bay, unity-gain antenna.  This would convert the 1 KW power output of the ITA transmitter into an effective radiated power of 2 KW.  

Upon their return to campus, Rick and Eric spent several hours in the plumbing shop on campus.  With the plumber's help, they soldered extensions on the antenna elements. Lengthening them so they could be tuned to 91.3 Mhz.  As the antenna's elements were arrayed in a V, the spacing between the tips of the lengthened elements also had to be restored to maintain the proper antenna characteristics.  This required melting the solder at the base of the antenna to allow its elements to be repositioned.   After they cleaned up the shop and the antennas had assumed room temperature, they were painted Jampro orange with a rattle can paint job.

The characteristic impedance of a Jampro V antenna was 50 ohms, which matched nicely with the RG-218 coax.  Each antenna was tested with Rick's precision Radio Shack SWR meter.  These inexpensive standing wave bridges were reasonably effective at VHF frequencies. It didn't take much power to set the reference level for forward power, and then switching them to reflected power would allow you to tune for minimum standing waves.  Since you were only tuning for a dip, the actual scale calibration didn't really matter.  Eric remembers the standing waves to be pretty low on Rick's meter but that tuning the antenna made little difference.  

Of course two antenna bays do not make a complete antenna system.  A power divider was needed to drive both of the antennas in phase at 50 ohms.   Fortunately, Harold had still had what was left of the old KKDJ antenna frequented about his home on Sandercock Street.  The antenna was lying in some ivy beside the house, and who knows what might have taken up residence inside of it while it was lying there. It was a 2-bay RCA ""birdcage"" antenna, with two birdcage style antenna bays being mounted vertically off the side of a transmission line.  In the RCA design, the transmission line served as a power divider for the two antenna bays, each antenna bay was shunt fed from the transmission line. The Jampro antenna system used a different approach, distributing the power from a central power splitter to the antenna bays through the RG-218 feedlines.   
 
Using the RCA shunt fed power divider to feed the Jampro antennas could lead to impedance mismatches.  Furthermore, the RCA power divider was designed to work at 102.7 Mhz, so the physical spacing between its antenna bays would not have been a full wavelength at the lower frequency of 91.3.   Eric and Rick compensated for the longer wavelength at 91.3 by adding some additional RG-218 feedline between the splitter and the antennas to make up the electrical distance between the wavelengths of 102.7 and 91.3 Mhz, taking into account the velocity factors of the RCA transmission line and the RG-218.   This way the two Jampro antenna bays could be mounted the proper distance apart, both physically and electrically.  

In case you are just joining us, KCPR's engineers had just resurrected a 1 KW FM transmitter and an antenna system out of pieces and parts found lying about San Luis Obispo.  Even in 1973, it would have cost many thousands of dollars to buy this equipment, but here it had been obtained virtually free.  Not having any budget, the station would have to seek donation of a couple more items.  

The next step was to find some coax to connect the ITA transmitter to the new antenna system.  Eric managed to liberate some coax from the old KATY-FM tower that was still standing on top of the KATY studios on Monterey Street.  Homer Odem owned this equipment at this time, so we talked him into giving us the coax, and a Gates RDC-10 remote control.  Eric remembers going with Harold to see Homer about donating the transmission line, ""Harold sat across from Homer at his desk in that huge office and suggested to Homer that he should donate this old stuff that was worth nothing to KSLY to KCPR.  Homer said something like ""OK, but I only want you to climb the old KATY tower to get the cable down.""  After all, Harold was insured.  Harold then had to say, ""Well, they already took it down and it's in the back of their truck!""  Homer glared at me, but he signed the nice letter that Harold had typed up which gave us title to these greatly needed parts to our 2000 watt puzzle.""  And that, my friends, is how it's done.

Now they needed somewhere to mount their new creation.  We were going to retain the original single-bay antenna on the roof of transmitter building as a standby.  The plan was to have a wooden utility pole installed a few feet away from the KVEC's transmitter building, just beyond the abandoned concrete foundations of KVEC's former AM antenna.  Pacific Bell donated and installed the utility pole for us.  

A two-inch diameter pipe was side-mounted near the top of the pole.  The two Jampro antenna bays would be mounted to this pipe.  The power divider would also be mounted on the utility pole and the antenna bays were connected to it with those custom length RG-218 feedlines.  Not to overlook a thing, Steve Ruegnitz's future father-in-law even contributed a pressure valve and gauge set that we would use to pressurize the antenna system with nitrogen.  The picture below provides a good look at the new KCPR 2-bay Jampro antenna along side KVEC’s 240 foot self-supporting tower on Radio Hill.

The impedance match between the RCA power divider and the 50 ohm Jampro antennas was unknown, but two things worked in KCPR's favor.  One, the ITA transmitter saw a reasonable voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) when it drove our new 2-bay antenna and two, the antenna survived it.  Since the 1 KW of power from the ITA transmitter had to be going some place, we can assume that the antenna was radiating it in a generally horizontal direction, the main lobe of a two bay antenna being fairly broad.  

Now that KCPR was about to evolve from a Class D 10 watt station to Class A status, it would have assume full remote control of the transmitter, and the DJs would have to start taking periodic readings the transmitter's operating parameters, such as the final amplifier's plate voltage and plate current, and keeping a transmitter log of these readings.  DJ training was going to have to take it up two or three notches to teach incoming students about how to deal with this.  
 
The operator on duty would also have the responsibility for maintaining the transmitter's output power.  He would have to adjust the transmitter's power remotely, if it got too high or too low.  These adjustments were typically needed to compensate for fluctuations in AC power line voltage at the transmitter site.  The older tube type transmitters didn't have any high voltage regulation, so we compensated for variations in plate voltage by adjusting the plate current to keep the transmitter operating within prescribed limits.  This was where the Gates RDC-10 remote control would fill in the final piece to the 2000 watt puzzle.  It allowed us to operate the FM transmitter under full remote control.  

Know now that it is May of 1974.  Poly Royal was behind us for another year, and KCPR is free to concentrate on the inauguration of its 2000 watt power increase.   The date we picked was May 29th at 11 AM.  That gave us a month to shake down the new systems and get procedures in place to begin operations at higher power.  We also wanted to launch the power increase before the end of the academic year, and before the start of final exams.  So the equipment was installed, the systems all worked, procedures were falling into place, and now the world needed to hear what KCPR was about to do!

13,,7. The 2000-Watt Power Increase Promos,"I started to get some ideas for promos to announce the 2000-watt power increase while walking home one evening. I worked out the ideas in my head and immediately wrote them down in pencil on that green engineering paper that we typically used for our homework assignments.   The themes of the promos drew on popular television shows of the late 1960's and 70's like ""Batman"" and ""Kung-Fu"".  Like the professionals say, write about what you know.  

Each of the scripts involved two characters talking with each other about the power increase.  The next morning I dropped into the station with my promo scripts in hand.  The usual suspects were about the studios, so I invited whomever I found to team up with me voicing the promos.   
 
Our news director Steve Greenberg was the first guy I found.  He teamed up with me to play Master in the ""Master and Egor"" promo.  The promos were basically one-take wonders.  We rehearsed it, got our voices where we wanted them, and cut the spot.  Afterwards, a lot of people didn't realize it was their News Director's voice on the spot.  Damn, they said, he's got some talent. Looking back at the original copy today, it's amazing how few changes were made to the original dialog when we cut the spot.

Here is the ""Master and Egor"" promo:

Eric Dausman then dropped by the station. He teamed up with me on the ""GrassSmoker and Master Sony"" promo.

Eric was perfect as the GrassSmoker.  It was so spontaneous.  We just did it.  His timing at the end of the spot couldn't have been better if we had done a hundred takes.  The KCPR record library really came through for us too.  All the music heard on these spots was pulled right from the stations production library.

Ed O'Brien teamed up with me as The Commissioner on the ""Batman"" promo.  The danger of picking popular themes like Batman for your material is that every fan has their own idea of what it should sound like.  This spot's copy underwent the most changes right there in the studio. 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab35rgg5eufmnmd/KCPR_2000_watt_promo_1974_Batman_Script_50-1.jpg

Ed's biggest contribution was the sound effect at the beginning of the spot.  Meant to mimic the ringing of the Bat Phone, it was a bunch of us whistling into the microphone at the beginning of the spot.  I think we recorded that sound effect on cart, so we could play it back and follow it with our lines.  That way we didn't have to whistle and then talk back to back. Ed's delivery was by far the most dramatic; you could believe we were in Gotham City!

So ""Batman and the Commissioner"" took a little longer to produce, and by now our activities were beginning to attract attention.  I think it was Al Beckner who came up with the idea for the Captain Quirk promo.  He dashed off a script in Studio B while we were busy with our spots. 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/hgavyn7j09nnwsa/KCPR_2000_watt_promo_1974_Star_Trip_Script_50-1.jpg
 
Then he teamed up with Cheryl Wright (a/k/a Morgana Hill) who played the role of Lt. Guru while Al took on the role of Captain Quirk.

The whole process from start to cart only took about 2 hours.  We took the cart with all four spots on it into Master Control where they received HEAVY rotation for the next couple of weeks.    

BTW, the power increase went smoothly.  At 11 AM on May 29th, 1974, KCPR became a 2000-watt radio station and thus the empire was forged.",nan,nan,,"{'record library': 0.8999999761581421, 'Steve Greenberg': 0.5, 'Gotham City': 0.5, 'studio': 0.3500000014901161, 'home': 0.3333333383003871, 'professionals': 0.30000001192092896, ""Ed O'Brien"": 0.27142857547317234, 'Al Beckner': 0.2500000037252903, 'studios': 0.20000000298023224, 'stations production library': 0.20000000298023224, 'suspects': 0.20000000298023224, 'GrassSmoker': 0.1666666716337204, 'spot': 0.13000000417232513, 'Eric Dausman': 0.10000000397364299, 'station': 0.10000000149011612, 'The Commissioner': 0.10000000149011612, 'KCPR': 0.0899999976158142, 'Each': 0.0, 'Kung-Fu': 0.0, 'Cheryl Wright': 0.0, 'characters': 0.0, 'each other': 0.0, 'radio station': 0.0, 'Morgana Hill': 0.0, 'Lt.
